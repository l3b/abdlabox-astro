Public speaking has always been one of the hardest things for me. Over time, I've gotten better — more confident, more practiced — but the overthinking never really left. If you gave me the choice between delivering a rehearsed speech or speaking off the cuff, I’d go with improvisation every time. I don't fully know why. I’m no expert in psychology, but I suspect perfectionism has something to do with it — the need to get every word *just right*.

That same hesitation has kept me from blogging for years. I’ve always wanted to write and share my thoughts online. I’ve made attempts before — drafts, mockups, even full designs — but I never managed to hit “Publish.” I wanted the blog to look clean, the content to be thoughtful, even if no one was going to read it. And so, for a long time, I stayed stuck at the start line.

## The world changed — and so did my tools

Today’s world isn’t like the one I hesitated in. Now, we have helpers — smart ones. Generative AI tools have reshaped how I approach creative work. These tools have become like companions: they assist in planning, drafting, designing, coding, reviewing. They don’t eliminate the fear completely, but they do lower the barrier. They help you feel like *you’re not alone* with the blank page.

What pulled me in the most was the **confidence boost** these tools gave. It’s the same feeling we all had when search engines matured — that sense of “I don’t know, but I can find out.” It unlocked whole new paths for learning and building. With AI, that sense expands: “I might not know how to do this... but I can probably figure it out fast.”

## Vibecoding and building with AI

This shift changed how I build things. Today, even if you’re not a full-time developer, you can describe your idea and get working code in seconds. You can tweak it, remix it, learn from it.

Take my [404 page](404.html) as an example — the error page people see when they hit the wrong link. I could’ve just redirected people or shown a basic message. Instead, I made it playful. It didn’t take long, and it made me smile. That’s the kind of tiny joy AI makes easier.

More importantly, this entire website — the one you’re reading now — was built using a process that blends my ideas with the help of AI tools. I used tools for writing, design, image generation, and cloud development. I didn’t do it all alone, but I did steer the ship.

I used [Replit](https://abd.la/replit) for coding — not because it’s the most powerful IDE, but because it’s accessible anywhere, even from a tablet. If you’re working with a team or trying to prototype on the go, it’s a perfect place to start.

## Moving forward

“Vibecoding” unlocked something for me. It’s not just about speed or automation — it’s about *permission*. The permission to start before you’re ready. To build something that works before it’s perfect. To hit “Publish” even when the voice in your head says, *“maybe wait a little longer.”*

So this is it. My first post.

Not perfect. Not polished to the bone.

But real — and finally, live.
