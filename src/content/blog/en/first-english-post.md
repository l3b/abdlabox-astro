# Welcome to My Blog

This is the content of my first post in English, written using Markdown.

![An example inline image](/images/blog/in-line.jpg)

You can also include images with captions using HTML:

<figure>
  <img src="/images/blog/example-with-caption.jpg" alt="Image with caption" />
  <figcaption>This is a detailed caption for the image</figcaption>
</figure>

```javascript
// Example code block
console.log("Hello Astro!");
```
